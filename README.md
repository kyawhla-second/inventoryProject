## About Laravel

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

## Offline & Portable Deployment

You can ship this application to a customer who has **no internet connection**.

### Option 1 – Portable Windows Bundle (SQLite)
1. Set `.env` to SQLite:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
   DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite
   ```
2. Create the DB and migrate:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p database && type nul > database\database.sqlite
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```
3. Copy a portable PHP runtime (PHP 8.x zip) into `runtime\php`.
4. Add a launcher `start.bat`:
   ```bat
   @echo off
   runtime\php\php.exe -S localhost:8000 -t public > server.log 2>&1 &
   start "" http://localhost:8000
   pause
   ```

### Option 2 – Docker Appliance (cross-platform)
1. Provide this `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     app:
       image: php:8.2-cli
       working_dir: /var/www
       volumes:
         - ./:/var/www
       command: php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
       depends_on: [db]
     db:
       image: mariadb:10.9
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
         MYSQL_DATABASE: inventory
   volumes:
     dbdata:
   ```
2. Ship `start.bat` / `start.sh` that runs `docker compose up --build` and opens the browser.
